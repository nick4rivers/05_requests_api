# Public API Requests

*Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Tech Degree - Project 5*

This is my 5th project on the full stack javascript tech. degree path, and a great introduction to using modern javascript to communicate with API's. This simple project taps into the [RANDOM USER GENERATOR API](https://randomuser.me/) to return some JSON which is formatted and rendered to the browser. Fun project, and a good introduction to:

- *Fetch* - For modern HTTP requests.
- *Promises* - For asynchronous programming in javascript.
- *JSON* - Parsing some JSON and generating dynamic HTML.

## Getting Started

Project files can easily be cloned and run in your own browser by opening the `index.html` file. Javascript used in making API requests, parsing the return, and dynamically rendering html can be found in `js/scripts.js`.
